# R Programming Exploratory Data Analysis
## 1. Defining the Question
## a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

## b) Defining the Metric for Success
1.Exhaustively apply the exploratory data analysis approaches while defining the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

2.Perform univariate analysis by calculating and interpreting measures of central tendency for the set of data.

3.Exhaustively perform bivariate analysis by creating relevant visualizations
## c) Understanding the context
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis for the give data set http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData
## d) Experimental design taken
1.Reading and checking our data

2.Clean data by finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

3.Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.

4.From your insights provide a conclusion and recommendation.
## e) Appropriateness of the available data
The dataset has appropriate columns and rows to answer the questions. The data is relevant for our analysis.
